 The while loop condition checks if the user has input 'q'.

 The first for loop reads through the string and checks for the
 initial redaction indicator <r>.

 If the indicator is found, the next loop will start after the '>'.

 Anything that is a letter or digit will be replaced by '*' with the
 substring method.

 If its not letter, if will not be replaced by a '*'. It will also
 if there is the second indicator </r> since '<' is not a letter or
 digit.

 Once the entire string is checked, the last conditional if statement
 will remove the redaction indicators and print the final result. It
 also prevents printing when the user enters 'q'.

 There are no known bugs. Anything that is entered should work, including
 a blank line.
